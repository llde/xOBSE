        - Made changes to improve robustness of overall ExtendData and ExtraData usages.

0017 beta 2:

[** Upgrade Information **]
  Several changes occurred between beta 1 and beta 2 which require attention for users of mods based on beta 1. All scripts based on beta 1 need to be recompiled in the editor in order to function properly. Modders please update your mods; users please contact the authors of your mods for updated files. Additionally, due to the introduction of reference-counting for arrays, modders should be aware that arrays created and saved using beta 1 are compatible with beta 2 provided that exactly ONE reference to each array exists. If your scripts make use of the now-deprecated assignment-by-reference operator '=>', resulting in multiple references to the same array, then your users will need to revert to a clean savegame.
  Please note that backward compatibility is not guaranteed for beta releases of OBSE. Once 0017 is officially released, we will maintain backward compatibility with the stable version.
